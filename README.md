## Steps

- Clone this repo:
 - click the green Code button in github, copy the URL
 - open the Visual Studio Code in your learning folder and and write in terminal `git clone paste_your_url_here`
- create a separate branch `git switch -c "dev"`
- add html and css files and code
- in VS Code, click on html file and Go Live (plugin installed previously) to avoid refreshing the page on changes
- when you're done coding, add the changes to staging using + button in VS Code Source Control tab or type on terminal `git add .`
